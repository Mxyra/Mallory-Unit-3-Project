            <h1>You walk into a house that seems familiar yet unfamiliar. There's a red substance all over the place. It's blood. You wander more and stumble upon something rotting, at least you think. There's flies buzzing. You think it's a murder.</h1>

            <h1>You walk in silence as you walk to the nearest police station. You feel as if something is watching you. As you go in you feel a weird vibe, eerie. You go up to the front desk...:"I think I have found the aftermath of a murder or some type of weird stuff." Police:"What makes you think it is a murder and not an abandon house with rust? Please state the address" You:"Yeah sure, the address is- 3334 Hurlington Ct, Broaden Jewel-" Police:"I'm sorry, but that address doesn't exist anymore, are you pulling my leg? Don't waste our time with nonsense."*But I'm not- something feels really off about this place* You:"NO no I'm not, I swear- I will come back with proof and then hopefully you can help."*I will come back* </h1>
